# TS---Taxi-Demand-Forecasting

**SUMMARY:**

Time Serie Regression model to forecast taxi demand through seasonal decomposition and feature engineer of lags and rolling-windows 

**Definition of the Problem**:

The company Sweet Lift Taxi has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, it is necessary to predict the number of taxi orders for the upcoming hour. A model was built to perform this prediction, with the goal of achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set no greater than 48.

There is a condition where the test set must be 10% of the original dataset. Test the data using the test set and provide a conclusion.

**Technologies Used:**

* Language: Python 3.10

* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
  * Main Libraries:
    * Pandas (data processing)
    * Numpy (numerical operations)
    * Matplotlib / seaborn (data visualization)
    * Statsmodels (seasonal decompose)
    * Scikit-learn (modeling, validation and evaluation)


**How to Run:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells in order.
